    This class is optimized for multiple tests requiring the
    database, by putting every db test in a large transaction
    avoiding the commit to the database, significantly speeding
    up tests by order of magnitudes.

    The one thing that is hard to test with this class though is
    the updateon or trigger tests. For that reason, if needed, it
    might be more beneficial to use the BalancedSlowDBTestCase class
