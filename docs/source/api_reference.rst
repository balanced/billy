REST API reference

it will be in **beta** stage for a while. Be ready to encounter some bugs if you 
are going to use it. When you find a bug, or you have any suggestion to this
project, please create an issue in our `GitHub repo`_.

supported. To access the API, you need an API key, except the one for registering
a company. The API key should be passed as the username for HTTP basic 
authentication, leave the password blank.

    anyone, do not post them on IRC. Also, currently, Billy API key cannot be
